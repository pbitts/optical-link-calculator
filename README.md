#Optical Link Calculator

## Who is it
This project is intended to help analyze Optical links' characteristics:
- Power per channel (dBm), 
- SNR (dB), 
- BER, 
- GWDM, 
- GNLI0

## Quick Start
There is already sample data for you to starting using standard parameters of fiber and modulation at sample_data.py
It can be easily run by :
    * using the command ```python main.py``` 

*Documentation under construction...*
